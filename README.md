# quadrag
QuadRAG is a practical project designed to explore / compare four different Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques using a single PDF document as the knowledge base. The goal of this project is to understand how different RAG approaches affect the quality, accuracy, and behavior of question-answering systems powered by LLM.
