      "\n",
      "1. Whether or not they are trained with human supervision (supervised, unsupervised, semisupervised, and Reinforcement Learning) (Section: Types of Machine Learning Systems, page 7).\n",
      "2. Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online versus batch learning) (Section: Types of Machine Learning Systems, page 14).\n",
      "3. Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points, or instead by detecting patterns in the training data and building a predictive model, much like scientists do (instance-based versus model-based learning) (Section: Types of Machine Learning Systems, page 9).\n",

However, it is mentioned that Polynomial Regression is a more complex model that can fit non-linear datasets (Chapter 4, page 128). The book also provides an example of using a 10th-degree polynomial to fit a non-linear dataset, with the result being a model that \"wiggles around to get as close as possible to the training instances\" (Figure 4-16).\n",
